/**
 This package contains the reference implementation for JSR107.
 <p/>
 This is meant to act as a proof of concept for the API. It is not threadsafe or high performance. It therefore is
 not suitable for use in production. Please use a production implementation of the API.
 <p/>
 This implementation implements all optional parts of JSR107 except for the Transactions chapter. Transactions support
 simply uses the JTA API. The JSR107 specification details how JTA should be applied to caches.
